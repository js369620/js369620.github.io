## Hi!

I'm Jack Sherlock. I am a game programmer and designer who has experience with various areas in video game development.

I attended Ohio University originally to study Computer Science, but I knew making video games was what I really wanted to do. So, I switched majors to Virtual Reality and Game Development and focused on learning about more than just the code that goes into making a game. 

Beyond my academics, I spent three years as a Resident Assistant with Ohio University's Housing and Residence Life department, and for two years I was the Motion Capture Specialist for the Ohio University Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) Lab. 

I want to keep making games and work in different areas to keep my skills fresh and diverse. I believe having a well-rounded understanding of the things that go into games is important for a game designer. I also want to be able to make games on my own, so having a bit of everything is a must. 

## Skills

Scripting: C# and C++

Software: Unity, OptiTrack Motive, and Git

Production: Game design, systems design, spatial audio design, and narrative design

Other: time management, public speaking, and project management
