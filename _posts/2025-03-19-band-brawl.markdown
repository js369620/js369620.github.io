I am working in a team of four to develop a game using Unity2D. I am our team’s lead programmer and producer. 

When we began, we agreed that we wanted to make something simple and small. I pitched an idea for making a 2D side-scrolling shooter that was combined with another team member’s idea for a game involving using musical instruments to fight hordes of enemies. As both this team member and I are members of the Ohio University Marching 110, we decided to use a bit of the band’s history when the University of Miami’s football team tried to warm up on the football field while the band was performing their halftime show. So, the game is about playing as a marching band musician who uses various instruments to fight through enemy football players. 

As the lead programmer, I am in charge of the core functionality of the game. I work on making the game mechanics playable in their simplest form so that I can pass them off to another programmer to add onto what I’ve made. I also code the game’s UI and the scoring system. 

The scoring system is the main competitive aspect of the game. To capture the spirit of arcade competition, I wanted to make it so that players who earned a high score could save their initials with their score and be able to compare their score with other players. Being able to see everyone’s scores is what drives players to keep playing and improve their own abilities and score. Currently, scoring is based on the number of enemies destroyed, individual enemy point values, and the amount of time the player survived. I have plans to add bonuses like kill streaks that will encourage the player to be more aggressive and take risks for higher score yields. 

The main mechanic for shooting is being on-time with the beat of the background music. Since this game is influenced by music, there should be something that ties the gameplay with the music and the narrative. By shooting with the pulse of the background music, the player can gain bonuses like additional damage dealt and extra points. This is currently being worked on and is not yet complete, but ideally, the player will have two cues for being on-time: listening to the music and seeing the background scroll by (the yard lines are meant to cross the screen on each song measure).
