For this project, I wanted to use CineVR to deliver an uncommon experience for fans of the Ohio University Marching 110. 

Most online videos of the Marching 110 are often from afar or to the side of the band during performances. So, I wanted to bridge the gap between the audience and the band by putting the viewer inside the band block. By using a 360 camera with an ambisonic field recording setup, I was able to capture the look, sound, and excitement of the Marching 110 for outside viewers to get a sense of what it's like to be in the band.

This was done in two attempts; the first had audio issues. Since the recording setup was in the middle of the band (and used 24-bit recording), loud sounds near the microphone would overpower everything else and cause peaks. To alleviate this, I was able to record in 32-bit float with upgraded audio equipment in the second attempt.

For the best experience, use an HMD; if not available, use headphones. A high volume is recommended for full enjoyment.
